# Velocity =  
# dom4j    = an easy to use, open source library for working with XML, XPath and XSLT on the Java platform
#            using the Java Collections Framework and with full support for DOM, SAX and JAXP.
# jaxen    = an open source XPath library written in Java. It is adaptable to many different object models,
#            including DOM, XOM, dom4j, and JDOM.  Is it also possible to write adapters that treat 
#            non-XML trees such as compiled Java byte code or Java beans as XML, thus enabling you to 
#            query these trees with XPath too.
# velocity = a free open-source templating engine.
